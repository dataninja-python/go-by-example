## Purpose: Learn Go Basics Quickly

Apparently, spending a lot of time playing around in a bunch of languages may get you comfortable looking at different
coding syntaxes, but it doesn't help you when you need to write actual code to solve a problem in a language more
complex than python or javascript - where nearly anything goes.

I learned this the hard way when I looked at problem #1 on Leetcode and couldn't come up with how to implement the
pseudocode to solve it in Go with the given Big O and other constraints.

NOTE: perhaps I'm not as dumb as originally thought. Instead, and more disturbingly, Leetcode must have a bug in their
software. Because when I switched to Go from C++ to solve question #1 regarding finding the sum of a target. The site
showed an initial template with a class implementation. 5-min of Googlefu later, I confirmed Go doesn't have classes.

NOTE: while I'm not as dumb as I thought, I'm still pretty dumb because I should have been certain Go didn't have 
classes so I could have spent more time solving the problem instead of Googling. Thus, I'm adjusting the original plan a
bit to include a quick review of the language before jumping into the problems.

### New Plan

1. Do 1-3 Go by Example tutorial to get a quick overview of the language. (30 min)
2. Do 1-3 problems from Leetcode, Hackerrank, or CodeSignal daily to get better at solving increasingly difficult 
algorithmic problems with Go. (30 min)
3. Work on a project from the freecodecamp video to get more experienced building full applications in Go. (60 min)
4. Set up an internal server network running kubernetes containers to practice deploying Go applications. (TBD)
5. Set up a CI/CD pipeline with a DigitalOcean droplet to practice deploying Go applications to production. (TBD)
